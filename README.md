# CylinderMC
Solution of Radiative Transfer Equation in a fibrous medium over a perfect black substrate with Monte Carlo method

Works with MATLAB

Thickness of coating, volume fraction and radius of fibers can be modified from main.m

Execute main.m to run the code, if the parallel toolbox is available code will be run on parallel

The code first calculates Mie 'like' analytical solution for a single cylinder at various angles. After it calls monte carlo method to estimate reflectance, finally net radiative cooling is estimated at post process.
